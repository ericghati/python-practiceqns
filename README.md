Question 1 : Sum all elements in a list.

In this code I decided to implement a function that allows us to add element in a list called sum_list_elements
I decided to use *args, to allow us to enter any number of positional arguments.
I initialized the list where values will be added
I then used a for loop for every value entered when calling the function, to append it into the list
Used a sum built in funciton to add all the elements fixed within the list
Displaying the final result. Final line in the function

We also call the function at the end
