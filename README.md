Question 1 : Sum all elements in a list.

In this code I decided to implement a function that allows us to add element in a list called sum_list_elements
I decided to use *args, to allow us to enter any number of positional arguments.
I initialized the list where values will be added
I then used a for loop for every value entered when calling the function, to append it into the list
Used a sum built in funciton to add all the elements fixed within the list
Displaying the final result. Final line in the function

We also call the function at the end


QUESTION 2: Check if a number is even or odd.
I used a function that would check if a number is even or odd called: check_number
The Function allows a user to enter any number they would like to check
After entering it, its divided by 2 to see if we'll get a remainder from that number, if we dont, we infer that its an even number. If the remainder is > 0, we infer that it is odd
I used an if else condition to check which condition was  met after that operation. 
For each condition a statement would be returned depending on the nature of our result
Finallty I placed the function within the print functionality to display the statement returned.
